# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 9, 2024**

## Introduction

PrivyAI ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection, use, and disclosure for our mobile application PrivyAI (the "App").

**Our core principle is simple: We don't collect your data. Your conversations and personal information stay on your device.**

## Summary

- **No data collection**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or conversation data.
- **On-device processing**: All AI processing happens locally on your device.
- **No accounts required**: You can use PrivyAI without creating an account or providing any personal information.
- **No tracking**: We do not use analytics, advertising trackers, or any form of user tracking.
- **No third-party data sharing**: Since we don't collect data, there's nothing to share.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

PrivyAI is designed with privacy as its foundation. We explicitly do **NOT** collect:

### Personal Information
- Names, email addresses, or phone numbers
- Location data or device identifiers
- Account credentials or passwords
- Payment information

### Usage Data
- Chat conversations or message content
- AI model interactions or prompts
- App usage patterns or session duration
- Feature usage statistics

### Device Information
- Device identifiers (UDID, IDFA, etc.)
- Hardware or software information
- IP addresses
- Network information

### Third-Party Data
- Data from social media accounts
- Contact lists or address books
- Calendar or other app data

## How the App Works

### On-Device AI Processing

PrivyAI uses on-device machine learning models to process your conversations. This means:

1. **Local Processing**: All AI computations occur entirely on your device's processor.
2. **No Server Communication**: Your conversations are never sent to external servers for processing.
3. **Data Stays Local**: Your chat history is stored only on your device in the app's local storage.

### Optional Cloud API Features

If you choose to use cloud-based AI providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or other services):

1. **Your Choice**: Using cloud APIs is entirely optional. The app functions fully with on-device models.
2. **Direct Connection**: When you use cloud APIs, your requests go directly from your device to the provider's servers.
3. **Provider's Terms Apply**: Your use of third-party AI services is governed by those providers' privacy policies and terms of service.
4. **We Don't Intermediate**: We do not intercept, store, or have access to any data you send to cloud providers.
5. **API Keys Stay Local**: Any API keys you enter are stored only on your device and are never transmitted to us.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All app data is stored locally on your device:

- **Chat History**: Stored in the app's sandboxed storage on your device.
- **Settings & Preferences**: Stored locally using iOS standard storage mechanisms.
- **AI Models**: Downloaded models are stored in your device's local storage.

### Data Deletion

You have complete control over your data:

- **Delete Conversations**: You can delete individual conversations or all chat history within the app.
- **Delete App**: Uninstalling the app removes all associated data from your device.
- **No Cloud Backup by Us**: We do not back up your data to any cloud services.

## Third-Party Services

### Services We Do NOT Use

PrivyAI does not integrate with:

- Analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics, etc.)
- Advertising networks or ad tracking
- Crash reporting services that collect user data
- Social media SDKs
- User behavior tracking tools

### Optional Third-Party AI Providers

If you choose to configure cloud AI providers:

- **OpenAI**: Subject to [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)
- **Anthropic**: Subject to [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- **Other Providers**: Subject to their respective privacy policies

We recommend reviewing these policies before using cloud-based AI features.

## Children's Privacy

PrivyAI does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since we don't collect personal information, there is no risk of collecting children's data.

## Security

While we don't collect your data, we've implemented security measures to protect the data stored locally on your device:

- **Sandboxed Storage**: App data is stored in iOS's sandboxed environment, isolated from other apps.
- **Encryption**: Local data benefits from iOS's built-in device encryption when you use a passcode.
- **No Network Transmission**: Your conversation data is never transmitted over networks (except when you explicitly use cloud AI providers).

## International Users

PrivyAI can be used anywhere in the world. Since we don't collect or transfer any personal data, there are no concerns about cross-border data transfers or compliance with regional data protection laws regarding our data practices.

If you use third-party cloud AI providers, please review their privacy policies regarding international data transfers.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect your personal data, traditional data subject rights (access, correction, deletion, portability) are not applicable to us. However:

- **Local Data Control**: You have full control over all data stored locally on your device.
- **Deletion**: You can delete any or all data by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the app.

## Conclusion

At PrivyAI, we believe that privacy is a fundamental right. By designing our app to process everything locally and collect nothing, we ensure that your conversations remain truly private. Your data is yours, and it stays with you.
